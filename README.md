# 💫 About Me:
Hi, I’m Swarnim Prasad, a final-year Computer Science student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at Manipal. I have hands-on experience as a Machine Learning Intern at Arivihan, where I worked on the design and development of robust, production-oriented AI systems. This role exposed me to real-world machine learning workflows, including data preprocessing, model development, evaluation, optimization, and collaboration in a fast-paced environment. My interests primarily lie in applied machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision, with a strong focus on building practical and scalable AI solutions.<br><br>I am highly proficient in Python and comfortable working with SQL and basic JavaScript. My technical skill set includes NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch (working knowledge), and OpenCV. I have experience with CNN-based image classification, medical image analysis, and comparative studies involving architectures such as Vision Transformers and DenseNet. I have also deployed machine learning models using Flask, built basic REST APIs, and implemented local inference pipelines.<br><br>My project experience includes a Radiography Detection system for classifying chest X-ray images into Normal, Pneumonia, and COVID-19 categories with detailed performance analysis, as well as an AI-driven two-wheeler recommendation system built using structured sales and vehicle data. Currently, I am strengthening my foundation in data structures and algorithms, system-level ML design, and improving my backend integration and deployment skills.
